## Ãœber mich

* Projekt [Here She Is](https://www.here-she-is.com/) - Introducing visionary and inspiring women

Ronja is a Risk IT consultant for a "big four" company in Vienna, Austria. She recently graduated
from the University of Vienna with a major in business administration and a minor in computer
science. She lived in Austria and the Netherlands during the studies as well as in Germany and the
United Kingdom. Her focus at Here-she-is is on her two biggest interests: politics and IT.

Ronja knows how hard it is to work in such a male-dominated field like IT. Hence, she wants to encourage
young women to take the step into a sector that is future-oriented like no other. Furthermore, she
hopes that interviews with inspiring women who have already successfully run for office shall help
to draw the curtain for more female engagement in this field.
